# eMedia

A simple UPNP mediaserver

> **This is a alpha version**. I plan evolutions that will involved major modifications in the database schema. So please **use this software for tests only**. The more you test, the more you report issues, the more we have chance to have something that's fit to your needs.
>
> Thanks in advance for your help.

## Install

> eMedia depend on ffmpeg and ffprobe (which is part of ffmpeg). For more informations about `ffmpeg` and how to install it, see [http://www.ffmpeg.org](http://www.ffmpeg.org).

```
git clone https://github.com/glejeune/emedia.git
cd emedia
make
./emedia start
```

See `./emedia --help` for more options.

> This new version comes with `emedia_explorer`. It's a very simple application, allowing you to explore the content of you media tree. This application is _experimental_. To use it, you need an Erlang version with `wxWidget`, launch `emedia` in console mode, then in the shell, execute `application:start(emedia_explorer).`.

## Configuration

The configuration is store in the `config/emedia.config` file.

You can add comments in a configuration file. A comment start with a `%`.

A configuration accept the following parameters :

* `tcp_ip` : IP binding
* `tcp_port` : port used by the server
* `medias` : path to the differents media directories. This option must be repeated for every directory. The value is a path preceded by the type of media found in the directory (`audio`, `video` and `photo`). Example :

        {audio, "/my/audio/directory"}
        {video, "/my/video/directory"}
        {photo, "/my/photos"}
        {video, "/to/classify"}
        {audio, "/to/classify"}

    In this example, the `/to/classify` directory is given two times, once to specify that it contains videos and a second time for audio.
    
* `scan_interval` : time interval (in minutes) between every scan of the medias directories by the server
* `tmdb_api_key` : API key used to access [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* `ffprobe_path` : Path to `ffprobe`
* `ffmpeg_path` : Path to `ffmpeg`
* `db_path` : Path to the eMedia database
* `lang` : Language used to retrieve media informations

Example :

```erlang
{eme_config, [
  {port, 9090}, 
  {ip, "0.0.0.0"},
  {medias, [
    {audio, "/my/audio/directory"},
    {video, "/my/video/directory"},
    {photo, "/my/photos"},
    {video, "/to/classify"},
    {audio, "/to/classify"}
  ]},
  {scan_interval, 60},
  {tmdb_api_key, "mY4p1k3y"},
  {ffprobe_path, "/usr/local/bin/ffprobe"},
  {ffmpeg_path, "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"},
  {db_path, "~/.emedia"}
  {lang, fr}
]}
```

> The configuration file contains many other parameters, do not change those parameters unless you really know what you are doing.
