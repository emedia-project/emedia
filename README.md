# eMedia

A simple UPNP mediaserver

> **This is a alpha version**. I plan evolutions that will involved major modifications in the database schema. So please **use this software for tests only**. The more you test, the more you report issues, the more we have chance to have something that's fit to your needs.

## Install

> eMedia depend on ffmpeg and ffprobe (which is part of ffmpeg). For more informations about `ffmpeg` and how to install it, see [http://www.ffmpeg.org](http://www.ffmpeg.org).

    git clone https://github.com/glejeune/emedia.git
    cd emedia
    ./start.sh --compile

See `./start.sh --help` for more options.

## Configuration

The configuration is store in the `config/emedia.config` file.

You can add comments in a configuration file. A comment start with a `%`.

A configuration accept the following parameters :

* `tcp_ip` : IP binding
* `tcp_port` : port used by the server
* `max_conn` : maximum connections accepted by the server
* `medias` : path to the differents media directories. This option must be repeated for every directory. The value is a path preceded by the type of media found in the directory (`A` for Audio, `V` for Video and `P` for Photo). Example :

        A,/my/audio/directory
        V,/my/video/directory
        P,/my/photos
        V,/to/classify
        A,/to/classify

    In this example, the `/to/classify` directory is given two times, once to specify that it contains videos and a second time for audio.
    
* `scan_interval` : time interval (in minutes) between every scan of the medias directories by the server
* `tmdb_api_key` : API key used to access [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* `ffprobe_path` : Path to `ffprobe`
* `ffmpeg_path` : Path to `ffmpeg`
* `db_path` : Path to the eMedia database

Example :

```erlang
{emedia, [
  {port, 9090}, 
  {ip, "0.0.0.0"},
  {max_conn, 100},
  {routes, [
    {"/description", description},
    {"/service/content_directory", service_content_directory},
    {"/service/content_directory/control", service_content_directory_control},
    {"/service/connection_manager", service_connection_manager},
    {"/media", media}
  ]},
  {medias, [
    "V,/home/user/videos",
    "V,/usr/share/videos",
    "P,/home/user/Photos",
    "A,/home/user/music"
  ]},
  {scan_interval, 60},
  {tmdb_api_key, "mY4p1k3y"},
  {ffprobe_path, "/usr/local/bin/ffprobe"},
  {ffmpeg_path, "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"},
  {db_path, "~/.emedia"}
]},
{mimetypes, [
  {load_async, true},
  {load_timeout, 10000},
  {load, [
    {default, [
      {<<"mkv">>, <<"video/x-matroska">>}
    ]}
  ]}
]}
```

## Architecture

![](emedia.png)

## Plan

* Rewrite `eme_db`
* Add "update" to the media scanner (allowing to detect changes in the media database)
* Support additional ressources
* Add a web interface
* Better media infos (using erlFFMpeg + emdbd) -> new media's classifications
* Use erlFFMpeg for media conversion
* Refactor SOAP support
* Rewrite `eme_ssdp`
* Rewrite `start.sh`
* Add DAAP support
