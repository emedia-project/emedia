# eMedia

A simple UPNP mediaserver

> This software is a WIP !!!

## Install

> eMedia depend on ffmpeg and ffprobe (which is part of ffmpeg). For more informations about `ffmpeg` and how to install it, see [http://www.ffmpeg.org](http://www.ffmpeg.org).

    git clone https://github.com/glejeune/emedia.git
    cd emedia
    ./start.sh --compile

See `./start.sh --help` for more options.

## Configuration

You can update the configuration by creating a file named `emedia.conf` in `/etc`, `/Library/Application Support/eMedia/`, `~/Library/Application Support/eMedia`, `~/.emedia` and `.`. If many files exist, eMedia will read then in this order and update the configuration consequently.

> Be careful, the `media` parameter is cumulatif.

You can add comments in a configuration file. A comment start with a `#`.

A configuration accept the following parameters :

* `tcp_port` : port used by the server
* `max_conn` : maximum connections accepted by the server
* `medias` : path to the differents media directories. This option must be repeated for every directory. The value is a path preceded by the type of media found in the directory (`A` for Audio, `V` for Video and `P` for Photo). Example :

        A,/my/audio/directory
        V,/my/video/directory
        P,/my/photos
        V,/to/classify
        A,/to/classify

    In this example, the `/to/classify` directory is given two times, once to specify that it contains videos and a second time for audio.
    
* `scan_interval` : time interval (in minutes) between every scan of the medias directories by the server
* `tmdb_api_key` : API key used to access [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* `ffprobe_path` : Path to `ffprobe`
* `ffmpeg_path` : Path to `ffmpeg`
* `db_path` : Path to the eMedia database

Example :

    tcp_port = 9090
    max_conn = 50
    
    # Medias
    medias = V,/home/greg/videos
    medias = V,/var/lib/emedia/video
    medias = P,/home/greg/Photos
    medias = A,/var/lib/emedia/audio
    
    scan_interval = 60
    tmdb_api_key = AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
    
    ffprobe_path = /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
    ffmpeg_path = /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
    db_path = /usr/share/emedia
